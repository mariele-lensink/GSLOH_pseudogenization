# GSLOH_pseudogenization

## Overview

The Arabidopsis gene AT2G25450, often referred to as GSL-OH encodes a protein that is part of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. This gene is involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, a group of natural compounds found in several plant species. The AT2G25450 gene specifically participates in the production of 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl glucosinolate.

In the 1,001 Population of Arabidopsis thaliana, the GSL-OH gene has a unique pattern of pseudogenization, particularly given its epistatic relationship to other genes necessary for the production of 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl glucosinolate. Theoretically, when these epistatic genes undergo loss of function mutations, production of 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl glucosinolate stops and selection on GSL-OH becomes effectively neutral. However, in the 1,001 population, there exists varying proportions of functioning and non-functioning GSL-OH genes despite their epistatic contexts. This project aims to generate a null expectation for the pseudogenization of GSL-OH under neutral conditions (mimicking a non-functioning 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway).

## IMPORTANT PROJECT NOTES
The data here represents a single example/simulation. From my tests, I recommend we run permutations or something because the outcome of the simulation is highly variable (In other words, there is work to be done). I have attached screenshot images from this example simulation below to demonstrate the analyses that I have done (proof of concept stuff).

## Gene Sequence Analysis Repository

This repository contains a collection of files and scripts for analyzing the evolution of a specific gene sequence under neutrality. The primary focus is on forward evolution modeling and subsequent analysis of mutant protein sequences derived from the gene.

### Files Description

- **`AT2G25450.1_fullgenomic.txt`**: This file contains the full genomic sequence of the gene of interest.
- **`AT2G25450_CDS.txt`**: The gene coding sequence (CDS). This sequence is used as the input for the forward evolution simulation.
- **`gsloh.slim`**: A SLiM 3 script for simulating the forward evolution of the gene. The script models evolution under neutrality over 10,000 generations with a population size of 1,000. It uses the coding sequence from `AT2G25450_CDS.txt`.
- **`gsloh_mutants.txt`**: The output from the `gsloh.slim` script. It contains mutant gene sequences resulting from the simulation.
- **`protein_lengths.csv`**: A CSV file generated by the Jupyter Notebook script `protein_comparison.py.ipynb`. It includes data about the translated protein sequences and their lengths relative to the ancestral protein.
- **`protein_comparison.py.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for analyzing the mutant gene sequences. 

### Jupyter Notebook - `protein_comparison.py.ipynb`

The notebook includes several key analyses:

1. **Translation of DNA Sequences**: The script reads the ancestral DNA sequence from `AT2G25450_CDS.txt` and translates it into a protein sequence. It also translates the mutant DNA sequences from `gsloh_mutants.txt` into protein sequences.

2. **Protein Length Comparison**: For each mutant protein sequence, the script calculates its length as a percentage of the ancestral protein's length.

3. **Codon Analysis**: The script identifies the last codon of each mutant protein that is shorter than the ancestral protein and compares it with the corresponding codon in the ancestral sequence. This comparison is then written to `protein_lengths.csv`.

4. **Data Visualization**: It creates histograms to visualize the distribution of absolute and percentage lengths of the mutant proteins.

5. **Frequency Analysis**: The notebook also includes code to count the frequency of each unique row in `protein_lengths.csv` (excluding the first column), helping to identify the most common mutations.
